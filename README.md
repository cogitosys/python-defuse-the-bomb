# Defuse the bomb in Python

This repository is a "defuse the bomb"-style training exercise in debugging python.
Reading the guide is recommended, but remember that the goal is to learn and the best way to do that is to explore a bit.

# Training goals:

* Become comfortable with running python code
* Become familiar with pdb
* Learn how to inspect and change program state from pdb

## Stretch goals:

* Learn how to inspect python program state from gdb
* Change program state from within gdb

# Acknowledgements

This exercise is conceptually based off the binary bomb lab from CMU (obviously adapted to Python).
